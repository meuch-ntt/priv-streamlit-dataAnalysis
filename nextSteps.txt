// FUNCTION Charts 
naming colliding, too much text : product category vs unit solds as barchart 

// FUNCTION Chart LOGIC
when choosing product category and product name -> third dimension appears. not correct.
new dimension should appear if numerical!! 
not only Count, also sum and average


ANOTHER BRANCH/ ANOTHER SOFTWARE VERSION - user not educated 
    -doesnt distinguish between numerical/ float/ in, for him all numericals 
    - remove type category -> consider object instead
