NEXT STEP 2) 
introduce Cach
all in one big main


NEXT 4) Charts
// FUNCTION Charts 
naming colliding, too much text : product category vs unit solds as barchart 
move all to plotting.py 

// FUNCTION Chart LOGIC
when choosing product category and product name -> third dimension appears. not correct.
new dimension should appear if numerical!! 
not only Count, also sum and average

Line Chart
-> ??? check for aggregation as well, sum/ avg??


NEXT 5) ONLY AT END
Refactoring: devide big main into smaller .py files 

ANOTHER BRANCH/ ANOTHER SOFTWARE VERSION - user not educated 
    -doesnt distinguish between numerical/ float/ in, for him all numericals 
    - remove type category -> consider object instead 
        remove category, all text category, except, more than 10 values?

// useability 
show sections one by one 
info text, data preview: next sections: possibilty change data type and make visuals 

//Usabiility
introduce logic for changing datatype, zb. float -> integer, makes no sense

// Low Fruits
Table preview starts with 0, should be 1

// Functions
first Show section KPI & Visuals when checked the type
