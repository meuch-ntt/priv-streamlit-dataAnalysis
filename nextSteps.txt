// FUNCTION Charts 
naming colliding, too much text : product category vs unit solds as barchart 
move all to plotting.py 

// FUNCTION Chart LOGIC
when choosing product category and product name -> third dimension appears. not correct.
new dimension should appear if numerical!! 
not only Count, also sum and average


NEXT 4) ONLY AT END
Refactoring: devide big main into smaller .py files 

ANOTHER BRANCH/ ANOTHER SOFTWARE VERSION - user not educated 
    -doesnt distinguish between numerical/ float/ in, for him all numericals 
    - remove type category -> consider object instead 
        remove category, all text category, except, more than 10 values?
